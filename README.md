# ArticleAlert
Welcome!
ArticleAlert is a program that utilizes SMS gateways and BeautifulSoup to scrape and send random science-related articles to a phone number of your choice (I suggest your own). 
It can be scheduled through task administrators on your respective OS so that it is mostly hands-off.

# Inspiration

Like many new adults, I found myself incredibly short on time. 
With full-time college classes, COVID-19, and a part-time tutoring job, I either forgot or simply couldn't devote time to my hobbies. 
Specifically, I found myself forgetting to research scientific news, which I find incredibly important to a broad understanding of the world and connection to humanity's discoveries in general. 
This way, with an email, phone number, and some scheduling programs, anyone can have articles randomly sent to their direct phone numbers. 
Hopefully, in the process, this program can help break down barriers to information access for not just myself but others as well.
